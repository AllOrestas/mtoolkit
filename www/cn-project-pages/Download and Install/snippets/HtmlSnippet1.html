<div class="h3"><h3>Development release</h3></div>
<p>
Development release represents the current state of the development of mToolkit. If you cannot wait the next stable release of mToolkit, grab the current development release and play with it. And if there is a bug, which have escaped our eyes, submit a bug report and will try to remove it for the next release. Or event better, when you submit the bug report, attach a patch with it. It is almost guaranteed that the bug won't make it to the next release.
