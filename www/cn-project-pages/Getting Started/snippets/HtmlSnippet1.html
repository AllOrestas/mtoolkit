<p>
Remote OSGi Management plug-in gives you ability to inspect and manage a remotely running OSGi framework. The view gives you quick access to the list of installed bundles, their headers, registered and used services and ability to manage bundles' lifecycle - install/uninstall/start/stop is all there, at the tip of your fingers.

<h3>How to connect to a remote OSGi framework</h3>
<p>
You can connect to any R4-compliant OSGi framework after you had installed a small bundle, which gives access to the internals of the remote OSGi framework.
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <eclipse>/plugins/ folder and locate org.tigris.mtoolkit.iagent.rpc_2.0.0.xxxx.jar plugin. Note: <eclipse> is your Eclipse installation folder, where mToolkit is installed. </li>
<li>Install the selected bundle in OSGi framework and activate it. For more information on how to install and activate a bundle, please consult the documentation of your OSGi framework vendor.</li>
<li>Confirm that the bundle is properly installed and in ACTIVE state.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
After the above steps, you are ready to connect to the remote OSGi framework.

<ol>
<li>Open Frameworks view by selecting Window -> Show View -> Other... and select mToolkit -> Frameworks entry.</li>
<li>Add new framework, selecting the Add Framework button and entering the name and the IP of the remote framework.</li>
<li>Close the dialog by selecting Connect button. This will connect to the remote framework immediately. The list of installed bundles should be retrieved shortly.</li>
</ol>

You can start exploring the view.
