<p>
Remote OSGi Management plug-in gives you ability to inspect and manage a remotely running OSGi framework. The view gives you quick access to the list of installed bundles, their headers, registered and used services and ability to manage bundles' lifecycle - install/uninstall/start/stop is all there, at the tip of your fingers. Additionally, Remote OSGi Management plug-in supports Deployment Admin Specification (Service Compendium, R4.1, ch. 114) and Application Admin Service Specification (Service Compendium, R4.1, ch. 116). This means that you are able to install/uninstall/inspect deployment packages and list/start/stop applications, which conforms to the Application Admin Service Specification directly from Eclipse.

<h3>How to connect to a remote OSGi framework</h3>
<p>
You can connect to any R4-compliant OSGi framework after you had installed a small bundle, which gives access to the internals of the remote OSGi framework.
</p>
<p>
Although the bundle is distributed with mToolkit<sup>1</sup>, it is easier to get it directly from <a href="http://mtoolkit.tigris.org/rel/iagent.rpc.jar">http://mtoolkit.tigris.org/rel/iagent.rpc.jar</a>. You can either deliver the downloaded bundle to the device and install it locally or directly install it from online source (if your device have Internet connectivity). After the bundle is installed, it must be activated (transition to ACTIVE state). For more information on how to install and activate the bundle, please consult the documentation of the your OSGi framework. After the bundle is installed and active, you are ready to connect to the remote OSGi framework.

<ol>
<li>Open Frameworks view by selecting Window -> Show View -> Other... and select mToolkit -> Frameworks entry.</li>
<li>Add new framework, selecting the Add Framework button and entering the name and the IP of the remote framework.</li>
<li>Close the dialog by selecting Connect button. This will connect to the remote framework immediately. The list of installed bundles should be retrieved shortly.</li>
</ol>

You can start exploring the view.
</p>
<p>
<sup><sup>1</sup>Â You can find the bundle in your Eclipse installation after you have installed mToolkit: open <eclipse>/plugins folder and find bundle with similar name to <em>org.tigris.mtoolkit.iagent.rpc_2.0.0.xxxxx.jar</em>. Another way is to use the <em>Get IAgent...</em> button in the dialog indicating connection failure.</sup>
