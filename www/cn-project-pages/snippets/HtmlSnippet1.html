<h5>January 5, 2010</h5>
<p>
mToolkit 3.0 was released. You can go <a href="http://mtoolkit.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=FhaayB">grab it<a/> and start <a href="http://mtoolkit.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=pRN3p8">playing with it</a>. We fixed many problems, which we found during the development, but some of them are still lurking around. If you find a problem (or have usability concerns and/or feedback), don't hesitate to file an issue and we'll do our best to nail it down.
<p>
Here is a short list of the notable changes:
<ul>
<li>Remote OSGi Management obtained support for applications, which conforms to Application Admin Service Specification: user is able to list/start and stop applications.</li>
<li>Usability tweaks have been made to the Remote OSGi Management: better console, better search and filter support, improved toolbar usage and many more.</li>
<li>Deployment Package Editor was introduced. It gives ability to easily craft deployment packages, which are fully compliant with the Deployment Admin Spefication.</li>
<li>Component Description Editor was dropped from the mToolkit distribution. The code is still available in <a href="http://mtoolkit.tigris.org/source/browse/mtoolkit/">SVN</a>, but the development is stopped at the moment.
<li>User documentation was added.</li>
</ul>
