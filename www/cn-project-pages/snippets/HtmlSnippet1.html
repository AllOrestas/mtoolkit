<h5>January 5, 2010</h5>
mToolkit 3.0 was released. You can go <a href="http://mtoolkit.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=FhaayB">grab it<a/> and start <a href="http://mtoolkit.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectProcess?pageID=pRN3p8">playing with it</a>. We fixed many problems, which we found during the development, but some of them are still lurking around. If you find a problem (or have usability concerns and/or feedback), don't hesitate to file an issue and we'll do our best to nail it down.
