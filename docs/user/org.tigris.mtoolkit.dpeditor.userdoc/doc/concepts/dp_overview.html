<h1>Deployment Package Overview</h1> 
<p>A deployment package represents a group of related resources which are treated as a unit. It is packed in  a JAR file which file name has a <b>.dp</b> extension. A deployment package can contain bundle resources and processed resources. The latter include non-bundle resources such as configurations, certificates, permissions, etc. Each deployment package contains a manifest file bearing information about its symbolic name and version, the resources it contains, and other. </p>
