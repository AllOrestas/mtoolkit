<h1>Quick Deployment Package Build</h1> 
<p>The Deployment Package Editor allows the quick generation of a deployment package after its properties have been preliminary defined in the Deployment Package Project file. Use the <b>Build</b> tab of the editor for the corresponding Deployment Package Project file to change the default file path for the deployment package generation.</p> 
<p> To use the internal generator of the Deployment Package Editor, select the Deployment Package Project file (<b>.dpp</b>) for the targeted deployment package in one of the navigation views, right-click on the node and use the <b>Quick Build </b>option from the pop-up  menu. </p> 
<p class="Note">Note: In case some bundle resources participating in the generated deployment package have different JAR file names from the saved in the Deployment Package Project file, depending on the configuration settings you have made for the Deployment Package Editor you will or will not be informed of the bundle file names currently used. </p> 
<p class="Note">Note: If you will sign the generated deployment package but you have not entered the password(s) related to the signer(s), a dialog is displayed requesting the missing password(s) to be specified. Otherwise, the signer information specified in the Deployment Package Project file is not taken into consideration for the current deployment package generation. </p>
