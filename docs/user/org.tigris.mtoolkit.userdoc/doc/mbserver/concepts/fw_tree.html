<h1>OSGi Frameworks  Tree </h1>
<p>OSGi frameworks are displayed in a separate view in the Eclipse Workbench - the <b>Frameworks</b> view. The view arranges the  OSGi frameworks in separate trees as you can unfold the tree of a connected framework and browse its components.</p>
<p>Basically, an OSGi framework tree has two display modes - <i>Bundles</i> and <i>Services</i>. In the Bundles (default) mode, the main components of the tree are the bundles, organized by category, the deployment packages, widgets and applications currently installed in the target framework. In the Services mode, the main components of the tree are the services registered in the OSGi framework. </p>
<h2>Bundles Display Mode</h2>
<p>You can observe the following hierarchy of components in the Bundles display mode:</p>
<p class="Note">Note: Following is the complete structure provided by mToolkit including base  features and available  extensions. </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Framework</i>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Application</b>
            <ul>
              <li><i>Application</i> - An Application compatible with the OSGi Application Admin specification, currently available on the target framework. For example, such an applications might be eRCP applications, MIDlets, widgets, etc., depending on the application containers installed in  the target framework. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Bundles</b>
            <ul>
              <li><i>Bundle category</i> -  Bundles are sorted by category according to the value of the <i>Bundle-Category</i> manifest header of the relevant bundle.
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Bundle node</i> -  Bundles are displayed by  symbolic name as set in the corresponding <i>Bundle-SymbolicName</i> manifest header, or if the symbolic name is missing - by name as set in the corresponding <i>Bundle-Name</i> manifest header. If the <i>Bundle-Name</i> header is not available either, then the bundle is shown by its file name. Optionally, you can choose to display bundle IDs and bundle versions as well. This is done via respectively the <b>Show Bundles IDs</b> and the <b>Show Bundle Versions</b> commands that appear when you right-click a bundle. Depending on the state a bundle is in - started or stopped, the  framework tree shows the bundle with different icons.
                      <ul>
                          <li><b>Registered services</b> - Contains all services currently registered by this bundle.
                            <ul>
                                <li><i>Service object class [Service ID]</i> - Shows the service object class (aka <i>service interface</i>) under which a service of this bundle is <i>registered</i>. The ID of the service object implementing the object class is placed within the square brackets next to the object class name. Note that a single service object can be registered under more than one object class.
                                  <ul>
                                    <li><i>Service property</i> (shown upon selecting <b>Show Service Properties</b> from <b>Frameworks</b> view's pull-down menu) - Represents a specific property that the service is registered with, such as <code>objectClass</code>, <code>service.id</code>, <code>service.pid</code>, etc. </li>
                                  </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                        <li><b>Used Services</b> - Contains all services of other bundles in the OSGi framework  used by this bundle.
                          <ul>
                                <li><i>Service object class [Service ID]</i> - Shows the object class (aka service interface) of the <i>used</i> service object. The ID of the used service object implementing the object class is placed within the square brackets next to the object class name.
                                  <ul>
                                    <li><i>Service property</i> (shown upon selecting <b>Show Service Properties</b> from <b>Frameworks</b> view's pull-down menu) - Represents a specific property that the used service is registered with, such as <code>objectClass</code>, <code>service.id</code>, <code>service.pid</code>, etc. </li>
                                  </ul>
                                </li>

        <ul>
          <li><i>Deployment
            package</i> - Deployment packages are shown by symbolic name according to the value of the <i>DeploymentPackage-SymbolicName</i> header of the package's manifest.
            <ul>
              <li><i>Bundle node </i>- Bundles are shown in the same way as in the <b>Bundles</b> sub-tree.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Management Servers</b>
(Available upon installing an extension)            
  <ul>
              <li><i>Management Server</i> - An OMA-DM server that can manage remotely the target OSGi framework. To be able to connect an OSGi platform to an OMA-DM server, it must have an OMA-DM client installed. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Widgets</b>
(Available upon installing an extension)             
  <ul>
          <li><i>Widget</i> - W3C widgets are shown by their name as defined in the <i>widgetname </i> tag of the <i>config.xml</i> files. To be able to install and manage W3C widgets, you have to enable a widget container on the target OSGi framework. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Services Display Mode </h2>
<p>You can observe the following hierarchy of components in the Services display mode:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Framework</i>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Service</i> - Services are shown by object class and with ID 
          enclosed in square brackets. You can view the registration properties of a selected service
          by using the <b>Properties</b> command from the context menu.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Registered by </b> - This node contains the bundle which has registered the service.
