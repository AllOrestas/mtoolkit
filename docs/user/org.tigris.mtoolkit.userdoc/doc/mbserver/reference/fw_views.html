<h1>Frameworks View</h1>
<p><a name="fw"></a>The <b>Frameworks</b> view provides the means for  administration of remote  OSGi frameworks. It supports connecting to OSGi frameworks as well as deployment and management of bundles, deployment packages, MIDlets and Opera widgets on them.
  

   For each successfully connected framework, the Frameworks  view provides a tree with the bundles, deployment packages, services, MIDlets, widgets and applications available on an OSGi framework as nodes.</p>
<p>The <b>Frameworks</b> view adds a view toolbar  as well as offers convenient commands in the popup menu and in the view's pulldown menu.</p>
<p>The view has two display modes - Bundles (default) and Services. As concluded from the modes' names, the main display units in the  Bundles mode are the bundles installed on the connected  OSGi frameworks with the services they are registering and using as sub-nodes, while in the Services mode the tree is arranged by the registered services on the connected  OSGi frameworks with the bundles registering and using them as sub-nodes. </p>
<p>To switch from the Bundles mode to the Services mode, right-click the  root node of the connected device and select <b>Show services</b> from the context menu. To return from the Services mode to the Bundles mode, again right-click the  root node of the connected device and select <b>Show bundles</b>.</p>
