<h1><a name="install_cr"></a>Installing and Uninstalling a Bundle</h1>
<p>mToolkit offers options for convenient installation and uninstallation of bundles directly from the Eclipse development environment. </p>
<h2>Installing a Bundle on  OSGi</h2>
<p>mToolkit offers several ways to install a bundle on a connected OSGi framework depending on whether you have it in the workspace (as a &quot;raw&quot; plug-in project or as a JAR file) or it is located outside the workspace. </p>
<h3>Installing a Bundle from the Workspace</h3>
<p>You can  install a bundle from the workspace on a connected OSGi framework if there is an active plug-in project dedicated to the bundle or if the bundle is built in a JAR file.</p>
<p>To install a bundle from your Eclipse workspace, in one of the Eclipse navigation views (e.g. Package Explorer) right-click the  plug-in project node or the JAR file node and select the target framework from the <b>Install to</b> menu. If you are installing the bundle from a plug-in project, the plug-in project will be built and exported to a JAR file. Then, the JAR file will be transferred to the  OSGi framework and installed. In case you are installing the bundle by using a ready JAR file, the file will be directly deployed on the framework.</p>
<p>On success, the installed bundle will appear under the <b>Bundles</b> node of the framework-specific tree. If the <b>Autostart bundles on install</b> option from <a href="../fw_preferences.html">mToolkit's preferences</a> is not selected, then the bundles being installed will not be started automatically - you have to start them  yourself. </p>
<h3>Installing a Bundle from outside the Workspace</h3>
<p>To install a bundle from the Devices view: </p>
<ol>
  <li>If more than one OSGi framework is connected, locate the target one. </li>
  <li>To install the bundle JAR, right-click the device node or the <b>Bundles</b> node and use  <b>Install Bundle</b>.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Install bundle</b> dialog, indicate the location in the file system of the bundle JAR to install and click <b>OK</b>. <br>

  </li>
</ol>
<p>On success, the installed  bundle will appear under the <b>Bundles</b> node of the device-specific tree. </p>
<h2>Uninstalling a Bundle from an OSGi Runtime </h2>
<p>To uninstall an installed bundle from the target  OSGi framework, in the <b>Frameworks</b> view select the bundle from the framework's tree, right-click it and use <b>Uninstall Bundle</b>. To uninstall several bundles with a single operation, simply select all of them in the framework's tree before selecting<b> Uninstall Bundle</b>.</p>
<p class="Note"><b>Note</b>: You are not allowed to uninstall bundles providing vital system functionality - uninstalling one of them might lead to loss of important OSGi framework capabilities.</p>
