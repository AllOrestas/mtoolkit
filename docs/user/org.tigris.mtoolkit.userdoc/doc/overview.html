<h1>mToolkit Overview</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>mToolkit  is a set of convenient tools for testing OSGi-compliant bundles on OSGi Runtimes straight from the Eclipse Workbench. mToolkit's open source and commercial extensions deliver a plenty of powerful capabilities to the development environment of Eclipse related to management, emulation and tailoring of OSGi Runtime images. </p>
<h2>Plug-ins vs Bundles</h2>
<p>The Eclipse environment supports pluggable units called <i>plug-ins</i>. The plug-in platform within Eclipse utilizes the OSGi technology - its core is an OSGi framework running the plug-ins which follow the OSGi bundle model. Across the user help of mToolkit, we'll use both terms, plug-ins and bundles, substitutively. </p>
<p>Eclipse, its 
  

   Plug-in Development Environment (PDE)
  
more specifically, offers a rich collection of tools for managing plug-ins (bundles) within the Eclipse IDE. It is recommended to develop a plug-in (bundle) by using an Eclipse plug-in project.</p>
<p> For more information about plug-ins and bundle in the context of Eclipse, refer to the &quot;<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/runtime_model_bundles.htm">Plug-ins and bundles</a>&quot; from the Eclipse-delivered help.</p>
