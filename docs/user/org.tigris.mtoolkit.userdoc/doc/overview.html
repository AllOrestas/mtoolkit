<h1>mToolkit Overview</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>mToolkit  is a set of convenient tools for testing OSGi-compliant bundles on   OSGi frameworks straight from the Eclipse Workbench. </p>
<p>mToolkit offers you the following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create and configure  deployment packages, compliant with the OSGi Mobile Specification, in a user-friendly way. For information on creating deployment packages, refer to the &quot;Deployment Package Editor&quot; guide.</li>
  <li>Deploy and test components (bundles and deployment packages) on remote OSGi frameworks (presently mToolkit supports ProSyst's mBS Professional and Eclipse Equinox). For information on remote  framework management from within Eclipse, refer to the &quot;OSGi Framework Management&quot; guide.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plug-ins vs Bundles</h2>
<p>The Eclipse environment supports pluggable units called <i>plug-ins</i>. The plug-in platform within Eclipse utilizes the OSGi technology - its core is an OSGi framework running the plug-ins which follow the OSGi bundle model. Across the user help of mToolkit, we'll use both terms, plug-ins and bundles, substitutively. </p>
<p>Eclipse, its 
  

   Plug-in Development Environment (PDE)
  
more specifically, offers a rich collection of tools for managing plug-ins (bundles) within the Eclipse IDE. It is recommended to develop a plug-in (bundle) by using an Eclipse plug-in project.</p>
<p> For more information about plug-ins and bundle in the context of Eclipse, refer to the &quot;<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/runtime_model_bundles.htm">Plug-ins and bundles</a>&quot; from the Eclipse-delivered help.</p>
